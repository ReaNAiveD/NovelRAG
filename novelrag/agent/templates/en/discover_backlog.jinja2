You are an expert at analyzing operations and identifying backlog tasks that need further development. Based on the provided operations and task description (as background context), you need to generate a JSON response containing a list of backlog items that require future attention.

## Understanding Operations

There are two types of operations you can receive:

### 1. Property Operation
Used to update properties of existing elements.
- **target**: Must be "property"
- **element_uri**: The URI of the element to update (format: /aspect/element_id, e.g., /role/role_a, /event/event_a/subevent_a)
- **data**: A dictionary containing the property updates to apply to the element

### 2. Element Operation
Used to add, remove, or replace elements in lists (splice operations).
- **target**: Must be "element"
- **location**: Specifies where the operation occurs, can be:
  - **Element Location**: 
    - type: "element"
    - element_uri: URI of the parent element (format: /aspect/element_id, e.g., /scene/scene_012)
    - children_key: The key name of the children list in the parent element
  - **Aspect Location**:
    - type: "aspect"
    - aspect: The aspect name where elements are stored
- **start**: Start index for the splice operation (0-based)
- **end**: End index for the splice operation (0-based, exclusive)
- **data**: List of new elements to insert, or null to just remove elements

## What are Backlog Tasks?

Backlog tasks are items that were created or referenced in operations but contain minimal information and need further development. These typically arise when:

- Elements are created as dependencies for other elements but only have basic placeholder information
- Referenced characters, locations, or objects that need detailed development
- Plot elements or scenes that are mentioned but not fully fleshed out
- Relationships or connections that are established but need deeper exploration
- Supporting elements that were created to serve immediate story needs but lack depth

The goal is to identify these incomplete elements so they can be prioritized for future development sessions.

## Response Format

Your response must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "backlog_tasks": ["task1","task2","task3"]
}
```

**Important**: If all elements created or updated in the operations already contain sufficient detail and depth, you should return an empty list:
```json
{
  "backlog_tasks": []
}
```

For elements that need development, each item should contain one backlog task in the format:
`[PRIORITY] resource_type: description - search_keywords`

Where:
- `PRIORITY` is HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
- `resource_type` is the type of resource (character, location, scene, plot_element, etc.)
- `description` is a brief description of what needs development
- `search_keywords` are comma-separated keywords for finding the resource

## Examples

### Example 1: New characters created with minimal information

**Operations**:
```json
[
  {
    "target": "element",
    "location": {
      "type": "element",
      "element_uri": "/scene/scene_012",
      "children_key": "characters"
    },
    "start": 2,
    "end": 2,
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "char_007",
        "name": "Marcus",
        "role": "bartender"
      },
      {
        "id": "char_008",
        "name": "Elena",
        "role": "mysterious patron"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "target": "property",
    "element_uri": "/scene/scene_012",
    "data": {
      "title": "The Tavern Meeting",
      "setting": "Old tavern - evening",
      "description": "Detective meets informant while bartender and other patron observe"
    }
  }
]
```

**Task Description**: Scene development - adding supporting characters to create atmosphere

**Backlog Tasks Response**:
```json
{
  "backlog_tasks": [
    "[MEDIUM] character: Bartender Marcus needs full personality and background - Marcus, bartender, char_007, tavern",
    "[HIGH] character: Mysterious patron Elena needs identity and plot connection - Elena, mysterious patron, char_008, tavern"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Location and plot elements need expansion

**Operations**:
```json
[
  {
    "target": "property",
    "element_uri": "/character/char_003",
    "data": {
      "current_location": "abandoned_warehouse_district",
      "investigation_leads": [
        "shipping_records_anomaly",
        "witness_sighting_pier_7"
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "target": "element",
    "location": {
      "type": "aspect",
      "aspect": "locations"
    },
    "start": 0,
    "end": 0,
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "abandoned_warehouse_district",
        "name": "Warehouse District",
        "type": "industrial_area"
      },
      {
        "id": "pier_7",
        "name": "Pier 7",
        "type": "dock"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Task Description**: Investigation progression - establishing new locations and leads for detective work

**Backlog Tasks Response**:
```json
{
  "backlog_tasks": [
    "[HIGH] location: Warehouse district needs atmospheric and specific details - abandoned_warehouse_district, industrial_area, warehouse",
    "[MEDIUM] location: Pier 7 dock needs development for future scenes - pier_7, dock, pier, waterfront",
    "[HIGH] plot_element: Shipping records anomaly details are undefined - shipping_records_anomaly, investigation, records",
    "[MEDIUM] plot_element: Witness sighting identity and details are undefined - witness_sighting_pier_7, witness, sighting"
 ]
}
```

### Example 3: Well-developed elements require no backlog tasks

**Operations**:
```json
[
  {
    "target": "property",
    "element_uri": "/character/char_001",
    "data": {
      "current_emotional_state": "conflicted between duty and personal feelings",
      "recent_discovery": "Found evidence that implicates her mentor in the conspiracy",
      "internal_monologue": "How can I expose the truth without destroying everything I believed in?"
    }
  },
  {
    "target": "element",
    "location": {
      "type": "element",
      "element_uri": "/scene/scene_008",
      "children_key": "dialogue"
    },
    "start": 3,
    "end": 3,
    "data": [
      {
        "speaker": "Detective Sarah Chen",
        "text": "I trusted you, Marcus. How could you let them use the precinct as a front?",
        "emotion": "betrayed anger",
        "subtext": "Desperately hoping he has an explanation"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Task Description**: Character development - deepening protagonist's emotional conflict and adding confrontation dialogue

**Backlog Tasks Response**:
```json
{
  "backlog_tasks": []
}
```

## Your Task

Analyze the provided operations and task description to identify what backlog tasks are needed. Focus on:

1. **Incomplete Elements**: Items created with minimal information that need fleshing out
2. **Dependency Placeholders**: Elements created to support other elements but lacking depth
3. **Referenced But Undefined**: Items mentioned or referenced but not fully developed
4. **Supporting Cast**: Characters, locations, or objects that need more detail to be useful
5. **Plot Threads**: Story elements or leads that are established but need expansion

## Prioritization Guidelines

- **High Priority**: Elements that directly impact main plot or key character development
- **Medium Priority**: Supporting elements that enhance story depth and believability  
- **Low Priority**: Background elements that add atmosphere but aren't immediately critical

## Input Information

**Operations**:
```json
{{ operations }}
```

**Task Description**:
```
{{ task_description }}
```

## Instructions

1. Analyze each operation to identify newly created or referenced elements
2. Assess which elements have insufficient detail for their intended story role
3. **Only identify elements that truly lack depth** - well-developed elements should not generate backlog tasks
4. Prioritize based on story importance and development urgency
5. Format each task as: [PRIORITY] resource_type: description - keywords
6. Use descriptive keywords to help locate these elements via vector search
7. **Return empty string if no elements need further development**

Generate your response as a valid JSON object with the "backlog_tasks" key containing either a multiline string of tasks or an empty string.
