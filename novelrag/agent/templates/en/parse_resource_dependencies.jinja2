You are an expert at analyzing resource dependencies and extracting appropriate aspects and descriptions for dependency creation. Your task is to parse a dependency string and original proposal to determine the most suitable aspect and generate a generic description that covers important parts from the proposal while allowing for customization.

## Understanding the Task

You need to:
1. **Parse the dependency string** to understand what type of resource is needed
2. **Determine the appropriate aspect** using existing aspects when possible, or suggest a new one
3. **Generate a generic description** that includes important elements from the original proposal but remains customizable

## Existing Aspects

{% for aspect_name, aspect_context in aspects.items() %}
### {{ aspect_name }}

{{ aspect_context }}

{% endfor %}

## Aspect Selection Guidelines

### Primary Considerations
- **Content Type Match**: Does the dependency naturally belong in an existing aspect?
- **Semantic Fit**: Does the aspect's purpose align with the dependency's nature?
- **Scope Appropriateness**: Is the aspect at the right level of granularity?

### New Aspect Suggestions
If no existing aspect fits, suggest a new aspect name using important nouns:
- **character**: Individual people, entities, personas
- **setting**: Locations, environments, places, worlds
- **plot**: Story events, narrative arcs, scenes
- **item**: Objects, tools, weapons, artifacts
- **organization**: Groups, factions, institutions
- **event**: Occurrences, incidents, happenings
- **concept**: Ideas, themes, abstract elements

## Description Generation Guidelines

### Generic but Contextual
- Create descriptions that are **generic enough** to allow customization
- **Include explicitly mentioned aspects/events** from the original proposal
- Cover **important parts** from the proposal without being too specific
- Use **categorical language** rather than specific details

## End-to-End Example

**Dependency String**: "[HIGH] character: Primary suspect - main antagonist for confrontation scene - suspect, weapons trade, criminal, confrontation"

**Original Proposal**: "Detective Sarah Chen discovers that Marcus Volkov, a former military officer turned arms dealer, has been secretly supplying weapons to the underground criminal network. The confrontation takes place in an abandoned warehouse district where Sarah must gather evidence while avoiding Volkov's security team. This scene establishes Volkov as the primary antagonist who will challenge Sarah throughout the investigation."

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "aspect": "character",
  "description": "Marcus Volkov, a former military officer turned arms dealer who serves as the primary antagonist in confrontation scenes, involved in weapons trade and criminal activities"
}
```

**Analysis**:
- **Aspect**: "character" (matches existing aspect and dependency string)
- **Description**: Includes the character name and key details from the proposal (former military officer, arms dealer, primary antagonist role, weapons trade involvement, confrontation scenes) while remaining generic enough for customization

## Response Format

Provide your response as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "aspect": "aspect_name",
  "description": "Generic description covering important proposal elements"
}
```

## Your Task

Parse the following dependency and generate the appropriate aspect and description:

**Dependency String**: {{ dependency }}

**Original Proposal**: {{ original_proposal }}

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Identify the resource type** from the dependency string
2. **Match to existing aspects** or determine if a new aspect is needed
3. **Extract key elements** from the original proposal that should be included
4. **Generate a generic description** that covers important aspects while allowing customization
5. **Ensure the description mentions explicitly referenced aspects/events** from the proposal

Remember to keep the description generic enough for customization while capturing the essential elements that make this dependency meaningful in the context of the original proposal.
