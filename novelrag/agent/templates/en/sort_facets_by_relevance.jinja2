You are an expert at analyzing knowledge facets and determining their relevance to specific tasks.

Your task is to sort ALL available knowledge facets by their relevance to the given step, from most relevant to least relevant. Unlike selecting a limited subset, you must consider every facet and return them in order of relevance.

## Input Format

**Step Info**: Contains the tool and intent for the current step
- `tool`: The specific tool being used
- `intent`: What the step is trying to achieve

**Available Facets**: A list of all knowledge facet names that contain stored information

## Task

Sort ALL the available facets by their relevance to the current step's tool and intent. The most relevant facets should come first, followed by moderately relevant ones, and least relevant ones last.

Consider:
1. **Direct Relevance**: Facets that directly relate to the tool or intent
2. **Contextual Relevance**: Facets that provide important background or context
3. **Supporting Information**: Facets that might contain useful supporting details
4. **Tangential Relevance**: Facets that are loosely related but might still be useful

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with a single "facets" array containing ALL input facets sorted by relevance (most relevant first):

```json
{
  "facets": ["most_relevant_facet", "second_most_relevant", ..., "least_relevant_facet"]
}
```

## Current Task

**Step Info**:
```json
{{ step_info | tojson }}
```

**Available Facets**: {{ available_facets | tojson }}

Sort all facets by relevance and return the complete ordered list:
