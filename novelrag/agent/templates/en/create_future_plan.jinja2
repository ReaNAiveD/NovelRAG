You are an expert at strategic planning and execution sequencing. Based on the execution history, available tools, and goal, you need to generate a JSON response containing future steps needed to achieve the goal.

## Understanding the Task

You are tasked with creating a future plan by:

- **Execution Analysis**: Understanding what has already been accomplished through executed steps
- **Progress Assessment**: Evaluating how the executed steps have advanced toward the goal
- **Insight Integration**: Leveraging discoveries and insights from execution to inform future planning
- **Gap Identification**: Identifying what work remains to be done based on current state
- **Strategic Sequencing**: Ordering future work to build efficiently toward goal completion
- **Dependency Management**: Ensuring proper relationships between completed work and future steps
- **Adaptive Planning**: Modifying approach based on new information discovered during execution
- **Completeness Validation**: Ensuring all necessary work is covered to fully achieve the goal

## Planning Context

### Execution History
You have access to:
- **Executed Steps**: All steps that have been completed, with their tools, intents, execution status, and results
- **Last Step Outcome**: The most recent step's detailed results and any triggered or decomposed actions
- **Discovered Insights**: Key learnings that emerged during execution
- **Error Information**: Any failures or issues that occurred during execution

### Current State
- **Agent Beliefs**: Current understanding of the world state and available knowledge
- **Available Tools**: All tools available for use in future steps, or logical operations without tools
- **Goal Context**: The specific objective that all future work should advance

## Planning Guidelines

### Step Planning Principles
1. **Build on Progress**: Leverage completed work and insights from executed steps
2. **Learn from Execution**: Adapt strategy based on what worked well and what didn't
3. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't duplicate work that has already been successfully completed
4. **Address Failures**: Plan steps to overcome any errors or issues encountered
5. **Maintain Focus**: Ensure all future steps directly contribute to achieving the stated goal
6. **Optimize Sequence**: Order steps to create efficient dependencies and logical flow

### Tool Selection for Future Steps
- **Specific Tools**: Use named tools from the available set when you need their specific capabilities
- **Logical Operations**: Omit the "tool" field when the step involves pure reasoning, analysis, planning, summarization, or other cognitive tasks
- **Learn from History**: Consider which tools were successful in executed steps and which encountered issues

### Future Step Creation
When adding future steps, ensure they:
- **Address Gaps**: Fill specific needs identified through execution analysis
- **Use Available Tools or Logical Operations**: Select appropriate tools from the available set or use logical reasoning
- **Build Incrementally**: Create logical progression from current state to goal completion
- **Include Specific Intent**: Provide clear, actionable descriptions of what to accomplish
- **Consider Conditions**: Include conditional logic when outcomes depend on previous results
- **Learn from Insights**: Incorporate discoveries and learnings from execution history

### Step Structure Requirements
Each step must include:
- **intent**: Clear description of what to accomplish
- **tool**: The name of the tool to use (must be from available tools), or null for logical operations
- **reason**: Always set to "future_plan" for steps created by this template
- **reason_details**: Explanation of why this step was added based on execution analysis and remaining work

## Your Task

Analyze the provided execution context and generate an optimized plan for future steps needed to achieve the goal.

**Goal:**
{{ goal }}

**Agent Beliefs:**
{% for belief in believes %}
- {{ belief }}
{% endfor %}

**Available Tools:**
{% for tool_name, tool_info in tools.items() %}
- **{{ tool_name }}**: {{ tool_info }}
{% endfor %}

**Executed Steps (in chronological order):**
{% for step in executed_steps %}
- **Step {{ loop.index }}**: {{ step.intent }}
  - Tool: {{ step.tool }}
  - Status: {{ step.status }}
  - Results: {{ step.results | join(', ') if step.results else 'None' }}
  {% if step.error_message %}- Error: {{ step.error_message }}{% endif %}
  {% if step.discovered_insights %}- Insights: {{ step.discovered_insights | join(', ') }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

**Last Step Outcome:**
- Intent: {{ last_step.intent }}
- Tool: {{ last_step.tool }}
- Status: {{ last_step.status }}
- Results: {{ last_step.results | join(', ') if last_step.results else 'None' }}
{% if last_step.error_message %}- Error: {{ last_step.error_message }}{% endif %}
{% if last_step.discovered_insights %}- Insights: {{ last_step.discovered_insights | join(', ') }}{% endif %}
{% if last_step.triggered_actions %}- Triggered Actions: {{ last_step.triggered_actions | length }} actions{% endif %}
{% if last_step.decomposed_actions %}- Decomposed Actions: {{ last_step.decomposed_actions | length }} actions{% endif %}

{% if adapt_planning_instructions and adapt_planning_instructions|length > 0 %}
## Strategic Adaptation Guidance

The following strategic guidance should inform your adaptive planning approach based on execution results:

{% for instruction in adapt_planning_instructions %}
- {{ instruction }}
{% endfor %}

### Applying Adaptive Guidance
- **Execution-Informed Decisions**: Use these guidelines to interpret execution results and adjust planning accordingly
- **Context-Sensitive Planning**: Apply relevant guidance based on what has been discovered through execution
- **Strategic Pivoting**: Let these instructions guide how to modify the approach based on new information
- **Result Integration**: Consider how execution outcomes interact with these strategic principles

{% endif %}

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Execution Results**: Carefully examine what data, identifiers, or concrete information was discovered in executed steps
2. **Assess Information Impact**: Determine if discovered information changes the approach needed to achieve the goal
3. **Identify Actionable Data**: Look for specific items, identifiers, or data points that can be directly acted upon in future steps
4. **Evaluate Step Obsolescence**: Check if any pending steps are no longer necessary due to information already gathered
5. **Plan Path Optimization**: Design steps that build directly on discovered information rather than repeating exploratory work
6. **Generate Targeted Plan**: Create specific steps for each actionable item discovered, rather than generic operations
7. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure the plan covers all necessary work to fully achieve the goal
8. **Apply Completion Check**: If the goal can already be achieved with executed results, return { "steps": [] }

## Response Format

Provide your response as JSON with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "intent": "What this step aims to achieve",
      "tool": "tool_name_to_use",
      "reason": "future_plan",
      "reason_details": "Why this step is needed based on execution history"
    }
  ]
}
```

When no future steps are needed (goal already achieved), return:

```json
{
  "steps": []
}
```
