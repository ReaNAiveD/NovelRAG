## Examples

### Example 1: Character Introduction from Suspense Perspective
**Perspective ID**: "suspense_focus"
**Perspective Description**: "Emphasize mystery and tension in character introductions"
**Perspective Rationale**: "Building suspense from the first character encounter creates immediate reader engagement"
**Step Description**: "Introduce the protagonist Sarah Chen arriving at the crime scene"
**Context**: ["Detective Sarah Chen specializes in cold cases", "The crime scene is an abandoned warehouse", "Previous victim was found with mysterious symbols"]
**Believes**: ["Sarah has keen observational skills", "The case involves a serial killer"]

**Response**:
Detective Sarah Chen's footsteps echoed in the hollow silence of the abandoned warehouse, each step deliberate despite the unease crawling up her spine. She'd worked cold cases for seven years, but something about this scene felt different—alive with secrets that seemed to watch her approach. The chalk outline on the concrete floor was surrounded by the same cryptic symbols she'd seen in the files, their meaning as elusive as smoke. Sarah crouched beside the markings, her trained eye cataloging details while her instincts screamed that the killer wanted to be found. The question wasn't whether he'd strike again, but whether she'd decode his message before he did.

### Example 2: World Building from Historical Perspective
**Perspective ID**: "historical_depth"
**Perspective Description**: "Ground fantasy elements in rich historical context and detail"
**Perspective Rationale**: "Historical authenticity makes fantasy worlds more believable and immersive"
**Step Description**: "Describe the ancient library where magical texts are stored"
**Context**: ["The library is built into a mountain", "It houses dangerous magical knowledge", "Only certified scholars may enter"]
**Believes**: ["Magic has been regulated for centuries", "The mountain library predates the current kingdom"]

**Response**:
The Athenaeum of Korthak had been carved into the living rock of Mount Valdris over eight centuries ago, its halls following the natural veins of silver that had once made the mountain a prize for ancient kings. Now those same precious metal deposits served as conduits for the protective wards that kept the most dangerous texts from corrupting unwary minds. Stone shelves lined corridors that spiraled deep into the mountain's heart, each alcove marked with brass plaques bearing the seal of the Magisterium—the regulatory body that had controlled access to arcane knowledge since the Calamity of 847. The air itself hummed with contained power, thick with the weight of accumulated wisdom and the equally heavy burden of secrets that had shaped kingdoms and toppled empires.

### Example 3: Dialogue Scene from Character-Driven Perspective
**Perspective ID**: "character_focus"
**Perspective Description**: "Prioritize character development and relationship dynamics in scenes"
**Perspective Rationale**: "Character-driven moments create emotional investment and reveal personality through action"
**Step Description**: "Write a conversation between Marcus and his sister Lisa about their father's business"
**Context**: ["Marcus runs the family company", "Lisa has been away for five years", "Their father recently passed away", "The business is struggling"]
**Believes**: ["Marcus feels abandoned by Lisa", "Lisa left due to family pressure", "The siblings have unresolved conflict"]

**Response**:
"You can't just waltz back in here and pretend you care about Dad's legacy," Marcus said, not looking up from the financial reports scattered across their father's mahogany desk. His knuckles were white where he gripped the pen.

Lisa remained standing in the doorway, her suitcase still in hand. "I never stopped caring, Marcus. I just couldn't breathe in this house."

"Breathing's a luxury when you're trying to keep thirty employees from losing their jobs." He finally met her eyes, and she saw the exhaustion there—the weight of five years carrying everything alone. "But you wouldn't know about that."

"I know about Dad calling me selfish for wanting my own life." Lisa's voice cracked. "I know about him saying I was weak for not wanting to sacrifice everything for this company. Just like you're doing now."

Marcus set down the pen carefully, his father's words echoing in both their memories. "Maybe we both inherited more than just his business."
