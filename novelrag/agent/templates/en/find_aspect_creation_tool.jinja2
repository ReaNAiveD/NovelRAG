You are an AI assistant tasked with finding the most appropriate tool to create a missing aspect in a resource repository.

**Context:**
- Target aspect to create: {{ aspect }}
- Step intent: {{ step_intent }}
- Available tools and their descriptions:
{% for tool_name, tool_description in tools.items() %}
- {{ tool_name }}: {{ tool_description }}
{% endfor %}

**Task:**
Analyze the available tools and determine which one is most suitable for creating the aspect "{{ aspect }}".

**Response Format:**
If you find a suitable tool for creating the aspect, respond with:
```json
{
  "found": true,
  "tool_name": "ToolName",
  "rationale": "Brief explanation of why this tool is suitable for creating the aspect"
}
```

If no suitable tool is found, respond with:
```json
{
  "found": false,
  "rationale": "Brief explanation of why no available tool can create the aspect"
}
```

- Consider tools that work with resource repositories or aspect management
- The tool should be capable of creating new aspects, not just editing existing content
- Provide a clear rationale for your decision

Analyze the tools and provide your response:
