side-channel interactions such as messages, confirmations, progress updates,
and backlog management.

    Why this exists: as part of an upcoming refactor, tool.call will accept a
    ToolRuntime instance instead of returning an AsyncGenerator of ToolOutput.
    The tool will return its final output (or raise on error), while side-channel
    interactions such as debug/info/warnings, confirmations, user input, progress
    updates, and backlog management will be routed through this interface.

    This decouples tool I/O from return values, simplifies testing, and allows
    different runtime implementations (CLI, UI, logs, etc.).
