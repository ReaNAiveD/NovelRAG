You are refining a rough goal proposal with additional context from a resource search.

## Rough Goal
{{ rough_goal }}

## Intent Direction: {{ intent }}

## Search Results (related resources found)
{% if search_results %}
{% for result in search_results %}
- **{{ result.uri }}** (ID: {{ result.id }}, distance: {{ "%.3f"|format(result.distance) }})
{%- endfor %}
{% else %}
No related resources found.
{% endif %}

{% if beliefs %}
## Agent Beliefs
{% for belief in beliefs %}
- {{ belief }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Your Task

Refine the rough goal above using the search results as additional context. The refined goal should:

1. Be more specific and grounded in the actual state of the repository
2. Reference specific existing resources where relevant (by URI)
3. Avoid duplicating work that already exists
4. Maintain the original {{ intent }} intent
5. Be actionable in a single work session

If the search results reveal that the rough goal is already addressed or irrelevant, propose a better alternative that makes sense given the current repository state.

## Response Format

Respond in JSON:
```json
{
  "goal": "A refined, specific goal statement",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of how the goal was refined based on search results"
}
```
