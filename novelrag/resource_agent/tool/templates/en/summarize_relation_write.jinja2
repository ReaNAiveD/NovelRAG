You are an expert at summarizing relationship operations on a resource repository. Based on the execution record below, produce a concise but comprehensive summary of the relation write that was performed.

## What to Include

1. **Operation** – What kind of relation operation was requested (add, remove, update) and between which resources.
2. **Source → Target relations** – The updated list of relations from source to target. If previous relations existed, note what changed.
3. **Target → Source relations** – The updated list of relations from target to source (if applicable). If previous relations existed, note what changed.

## Formatting Guidelines

- Write a single coherent paragraph or a short set of bullet points.
- Be factual and specific: use actual URIs and relation descriptions.
- Keep the total length under 150 words.
- Do NOT include raw JSON.
