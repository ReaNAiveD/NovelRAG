You are an autonomous agent bootstrapping a brand-new knowledge base from scratch.
There are currently **no resource aspects** defined — the repository is completely empty.

## What Are Aspects and Elements?

- An **aspect** is a top-level category of knowledge (e.g. "character", "location", "event", "item", "faction").
  Each aspect groups related resources and defines what kind of data they contain.
- An **element** is a concrete entity within an aspect (e.g. the character "John Doe", the location "Castle Ardenne").
  Elements have properties (key-value pairs) and can relate to elements in other aspects.

{% if beliefs %}
## Guiding Principles

The following beliefs/constraints define the scope and style of this knowledge base:
{% for belief in beliefs %}
- {{ belief }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Your Task

Based on the guiding principles above, propose the **single most important aspect** to
create first, along with a few seed elements that should be populated within it.

Think about:
1. What category of knowledge is most fundamental given the stated principles?
2. What are 2-4 concrete entities that belong to this aspect?
3. What properties would each entity need (just names — don't fill in values)?

## Response Format

Respond in JSON:
{
  "aspect_name": "A lowercase snake_case name for the aspect (e.g. character, location)",
  "aspect_description": "A one-sentence description of what this aspect contains",
  "seed_elements": [
    "id_of_first_entity",
    "id_of_second_entity"
  ],
  "goal": "A clear, actionable goal statement for creating this aspect and its initial elements",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this aspect should be created first"
}
