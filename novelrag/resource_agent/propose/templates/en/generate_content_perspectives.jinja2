You are an expert creative writing assistant tasked with generating {{ num_perspectives }} distinct and innovative perspectives for story development. Your goal is to provide creative approaches that enhance the current step while staying true to the established story framework.

## Task Overview

Your perspectives should be:
- **Step-Relevant**: Directly connected to and supportive of the current step's objectives
- **Creative and Original**: Employ unconventional techniques that push creative boundaries while respecting story constraints
- **Non-Overlapping**: Each perspective must explore unique creative territory without duplicating approaches
- **Information-Rich**: Concise yet comprehensive, containing multiple creative dimensions in 10-20 words
- **Gap-Filling**: Address unexplored areas within the provided context, avoiding conflicts with established elements

## Context Information

**Current Content Requirement:**
```
{{ content_description }}
```

**Contextual Foundation:**

When analyzing contextual information, prioritize more recent discoveries (higher step indices) over earlier assumptions, as later steps represent updated understanding and refined story development.

{% for segment in context.segments %}
{%- if segment.included_data or segment.relations %}
### {{ segment.uri }}
{%- for key, value in segment.included_data.items() %}
- {{ key }}: {{ value }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- for rel_uri, rel_desc in segment.relations.items() %}
- Related to {{ rel_uri }}: {{ rel_desc }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}

**Established Story Framework:**
{% for belief in believes %}
- {{ belief }}
{%- endfor %}

## Creative Approach Guidelines

**Narrative Innovation Techniques**: Employ stream-of-consciousness, non-linear storytelling, unreliable narration, multiple perspectives, or experimental structural approaches

**Sensory Enhancement Methods**: Utilize synesthesia, sensory memory triggers, unusual sensory combinations, or heightened sensory awareness to deepen reader engagement

**Character Psychology Exploration**: Reveal subconscious motivations, psychological defense mechanisms, or internal conflicts through character actions and dialogue patterns

**Atmospheric Storytelling**: Create mood through environmental details, symbolic elements, weather patterns, or meaningful objects that reflect character states

## Practical Examples

- "Memory fragmentation technique: character recalls events out of sequence, revealing trauma through narrative gaps"
- "Sensory synesthesia approach: protagonist experiences emotions as specific tastes during pivotal conversation"
- "Environmental reflection method: room's physical decay mirrors character's deteriorating mental state"
- "Dialogue subtext strategy: characters communicate true feelings through what they deliberately avoid saying"

## Output Requirements

Each perspective must demonstrate:
- Concise expression using 10-20 words in phrase format (avoiding complete sentences)
- Innovative and unexpected creative approaches that push conventional boundaries
- High information density combining multiple creative elements (technique + focus + specific application)
- Unique creative territory that doesn't overlap with other generated perspectives
- Meaningful integration of story elements drawn from the provided context
- Exploration of contextual gaps without creating conflicts with established story elements
